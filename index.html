          <h2>What is a Bunion?</h2>
          <p>A bunion forms when your big‑toe joint drifts out of alignment, creating the painful bump on the side of your foot.</p>
          <p>The medical term is <em>hallux valgus</em>. Misalignment can cause persistent pain, especially in tight shoes.</p>
          <p>Left untreated, bunions may trigger hammertoes, calluses, and chronic discomfort that limits your daily activities.</p>
